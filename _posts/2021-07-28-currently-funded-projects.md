# Currently Funded Projects

*Here are some of the projects we are working on…*

“Canadian COVID-19 Genomics Network (CanCOGeN): VirusSeq Project”
Genome Canada / ISED special project associated with the $40 million dollar CanCOGeN government initiative. I am a co-PI and on the main Implementation Committee for this project involving 42 Canadian universities, hospitals, government labs, industry, and genome centres. I also co-lead the VirusSeq Data Analytics Working Group, lead the Research Collaborations Working Group, and am a participant on other committees including Ethics and Governance and Data Sharing.

CIHR Grant: COVID-19. Rapid Research Funding Opportunity competition. Designated PI Meghan Azad. I am a co-applicant in bioinformatics.

“Causational Roles of the Gut Microbiome in Childhood Asthma: Leveraging the CHILD Cohort Study”
Team Grant: Canadian Microbiome Initiative 2: Involves a team of 15 PIs. I am a Co-Applicant involved in data integration and bioinformatics analyses.

“IMPACTT: Integrated Microbiome Platforms to Advance Causation Testing and Translation.”
CIHR Canadian Microbiome Initiative 2: Research Core. Kathy McCoy, Designated PI. I am Co-PI and Co-Lead of Bioinformatics.
